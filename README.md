### Flexbox Froggy
I have very minimal front end experience (HTML, CSS, and Javscript); the most CSS I've done before this was copy and paste code from Bootstrap and tweak to my liking. This exercise showed me how to use CSS properties like justify-content, align-items, flex-direction, order, align-self, flex-wrap, flex-flow, and align-content. This will help me format, layout, and style my pages.
