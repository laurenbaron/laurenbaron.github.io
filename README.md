### Flexbox Froggy (CSS)
I have very minimal front end experience (HTML, CSS, and Javscript). The most CSS I've done before this was copy and paste code from Bootstrap and tweak to my liking. The most HTML experience I've had was making a website with Python/Flask in CISC108. This exercise showed me how to use CSS properties like justify-content, align-items, flex-direction, order, align-self, flex-wrap, flex-flow, and align-content. This will help me format, layout, and style my pages.

### Tic Tac Toe (React)
I have no experience with React but am excited to learn because it's an industry standard for web dev.
